## <a id="aboutme"> About me 
Agriculture is a most important and ancient occupation in India. As economy of India is based on agricultural production,
    utmost care of food production is necessary. Pests like virus, fungus and bacteria causes infection to plants with 
    loss in quality and quantity production. There is large amount of loss of farmer in production. Hence proper care of
    plants is necessary for same. Image processing provides more efficient ways to detect diseases caused by fungus, 
    bacteria or virus on plants. **Mere observations by eyes to detect diseases are not accurate.** Excess use also damages
    plants nutrient quality. It results in huge loss of production to farmer. Hence use of image processing techniques 
    to detect and classify diseases in agricultural applications is helpful.
